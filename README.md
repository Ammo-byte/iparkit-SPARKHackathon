# iparkit-SPARKHackathon
Our code and business pitch for Spark Hackathon 2019. I worked in a team of 5 and got to contribute a bit to the code. THE CODE IS NOT JUST MINE, IT WAS A COLLECTIVE TEAM EFFORT. I HELPED DEBUG THE CODE AND INPUT IDEAS ON WHAT TO ADD TO THE REST OF TEAM. The theme that we were given was "Sustainable, Smart Cities".  The app was based off our idea on a crowd-sourcing company, (iParkIT) where users can rent out their driveway space to other users. Essentially, it's Uber but with driveway spaces. 

Our team successfully managed to win "Best Pitch" in the entire Hackathon! :)  


*STILL WORKING ON UPLOADING THE ACTUAL GRADLE APP ONTO GITHUB.*
